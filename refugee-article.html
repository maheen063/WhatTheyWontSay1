            <h1 class="article-title">Why Western Countries Love Refugees Only in Inspirational Stories</h1>
            <p class="author">By Inaya Malik</p>

                When the Swimmers movie was released, I, like countless others, was one of the first to watch it. It delivered an inspiring albeit Westernized story that felt more centered on the West's ideals of a refugee, accomplished, photogenic, and award-winning. It got me thinking, when we think about refugees, who are the first people to come to our minds? Malala Yousafzai, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning education activist, or Doaa Al Zamel, a Syrian refugee who survived a shipwreck and wrote a bestselling memoir. But what these refugees have in common isn't their status, it's their accomplishments. But what about the countless refugees who aren't famous? What about those who aren't acclaimed, the forgotten names and stories?
            </p>
            <p class="article-body">
                We love refugees when they are confined to the pages of a memoir or the stage of a TED talk. We love a romanticized version of them, one that is photogenic rather than one that showcases their struggles and status as a refugee. However, the most upsetting thing is the internalized xenophobia of so many who applaud refugees publicly, but how many of these people would welcome them, or someone like them, into their neighborhood? How many would vote for policies that make it easier for refugees to find safety? This hypocrisy is dangerous. It allows us to applaud ourselves for our supposed compassion while ignoring the systematic failures that leave millions of refugees stranded, exploited or worse.

                Take the case of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy whose lifeless body washed ashore in 2016. For a brief moment, the world seemed to take notice. Politicians expressed outrage, hashtags trended, and donations poured in. But what happened after the outrage died down? Nothing. And what happened to the countless children who died in similar circumstances? Are their stories not just as rage-provoking, not just as harrowing?
            </p>
            <p class="article-body">
                According to the UNHCR, there are over 122.6 million refugees worldwide, the highest number since World War Two. Yet the global north has responded with restrictive immigration policies. In 2022, the EU recorded at least 120,000 illegal pushbacks of refugees, often involving violence and human rights violations. The United Kingdom's infamous Rwanda asylum plan, which proposes relocating asylum seekers to another country, is another example of the extent humanitarian principles are subordinated to political expediency.
            </p>
            <p class="article-body">
                Even when refugees are grudgingly allowed asylum, their treatment vastly differs from the glowing narratives. In Germany, often lauded for its open-door policy during the 2015 refugee crisis, refugees frequently face significant challenges. A study by the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research found that only half of refugees had found stable employment five years after arrival, and many still had limited access to education and healthcare.
            </p>
            <p class="article-body">
                The USA, despite its history as a nation of immigrants, has failed to uphold its commitments. In 2022, the Biden administration set a refugee admission cap of 85,000 but admitted only 25.465 individuals. Meanwhile, asylum seekers are frequently detained in overcrowded facilities where stories of inadequate living conditions and abuse are common.
            </p>
            <p class="article-body">
                The problem isn't only policy; it's perception. Refugees are often reduced to either helpless victims or extraordinary heroes. This framing hides the true complexity of their situations and causes societies to ignore the root causes of displacement, war persecution, and authoritarian regimes. By romanticizing refugee stories, we risk commodifying their suffering, transforming it into accolades while neglecting the reforms necessary to alleviate it.
            </p>
            <p class="article-body">
                The story of Doaa al-Zamel is an interesting example. Her memoir A Hope More Powerful than the Sea recounts her survival of a shipwreck in the Mediterranean. While the story has garnered acclaim, it also highlights the consequences of constrictive immigration policies. For every Doaa, every Malala, every Alan, there are countless others whose stories remain untold, their stories drowning underneath the oceans and languishing in refugee camps. As Doaa said, “It is our right to live in peace and to end the war that has displaced millions of people who have sought refuge and who have tragically died at sea.”
            </p>
            <p class="article-body">
                To bridge the gap between inspirational narratives and reality, Western nations must abandon performative actions and create policies that reflect humanitarian standards. This includes expanding legal pathways for refugee admission, forming integration programs, and addressing the root causes of displacement. It also requires a shift in public perception, recognizing refugees not as symbols or statistics but as humans deserving of all fundamental human rights.
            </p>
            <p class="article-body">
                In conclusion, it is time to stop treating refugees as characters in a movie. They don't exist to inspire us or make us feel better about ourselves. They are here because they have no other choice. So next time you see a heartwarming refugee story, ask yourself, is this honoring resilience or just a convenient distraction from the truth of their displacement? In a world that claims to champion the principles of justice and compassion, refugees do not need to be extraordinary to warrant our support; they only need to be human. And that should be more than enough.
